# Testing Plan

To test this application, I'll be performing white box testing in the form of unit tests for the methods in the model component with JUnit.
Since user interface frameworks such as JavaFX are notoriously difficult to test, and the user interface for my application is incredibly simple, I won't be performing any integration testing.
